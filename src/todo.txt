- Deinterleave first channel directly into FFT buffer
- Cast last channel directly out of output buffer
- Return final casting and channel combining as an iterator
- Make an iterator that does the scaling to the window size
- Keep a *mut c_char for each ncurses row and read output iterator directly
  into this matrix
- Handle window resizing after these optimizations
- Make a better algorithm for scaling to window size (so we get exact columns)
- Print frequencies on bottom of visualizer
